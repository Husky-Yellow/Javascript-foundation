        <h1>Welcome The Internet, The Nice Version</h1>
        <p>Was Phileas Fogg rich? Undoubtedly. But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his
            fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information. He was not lavish, nor, on
            the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever
            he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and
            sometimes anonymously. He was, in short, the least communicative of men. He talked very little, and seemed
            all the more mysterious for his taciturn
            manner. His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing
            that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.</p>

        <p>Had he travelled? It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so
            secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it. He often corrected, with a few
            clear words, the thousand conjectures
            advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true probabilities,
            and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions. He must
            have travelled everywhere, at
            least in the spirit.</p>
